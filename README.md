🌌 Visionary AI: Offline Text-to-Image RendererVisionary AI is a lightweight, fully offline Streamlit application that transforms raw text into structured, high-quality images. While modern AI models rely on expensive cloud APIs and unstable internet connections, this project prioritizes privacy, speed, and reproducibility.🚀 Why This Project?Most "Text-to-Image" tools today are black boxes. You send data to a cloud, wait for a response, and hope you haven't hit a usage limit. Visionary AI flips the script:Privacy-First: Your text never leaves your machine. Perfect for restricted or academic environments.Zero Latency: No API calls, no "server busy" messages.Structured Output: Specifically designed for documentation, presentations, and text visualization.🛠️ Key Features✍️ High-Capacity Input: Supports up to 1500 characters per render.📄 Smart Formatting: Automatic line-wrapping at 100 characters for optimal readability.📥 Professional Exports: One-click downloads for PNG (image) and PDF (document).☁️ Cloud Ready: Optimized for zero-config deployment on Streamlit Cloud.🔒 No Dependencies: No API keys, no secret tokens, no paid subscriptions.🆚 Comparison: Visionary AI vs. Cloud AIFeatureVisionary AIChatGPT / GeminiOffline Usage✅ Full Support❌ Requires InternetCost💰 Free Forever💳 Subscription/API FeesData Privacy🔒 Local Only☁️ Cloud ProcessedReproducibility🎯 100% Consistent🎲 Random/GenerativeUsage Limits♾️ Unlimited⏳ Rate Limited🧠 How It WorksThe processing pipeline is transparent and predictable:Sanitization: The engine cleans the input text and validates character counts.Segmentation: Text is partitioned into an array of strings based on the 100-character line-limit.Canvas Mapping: Using the Pillow (PIL) library, a high-resolution canvas is initialized.Rasterization: Text is drawn line-by-line onto the image buffer.Serialization: The final buffer is converted into downloadable byte streams for PNG and PDF formats.🛠️ Tech StackInterface: StreamlitEngine: Pillow (PIL)File Handling: io & ReportLab (Optional for advanced PDF)💻 Getting Started1️⃣ Clone and SetupBash# Clone the repository

📌 Future Roadmap[ ] Dynamic Scaling: Auto-adjust font size based on text volume.[ ] Custom Themes: Dark mode, Sepia, and Professional Blue backgrounds.[ ] Font Library: Integration with Google Fonts for custom typography.[ ] Local LLM: Optional integration with local models (Ollama/Llama3).👨‍💻 AuthorVasu Margana Computer Science Undergraduate | AI & ML EnthusiastNote: This project is designed for text visualization and structured documentation. It focuses on the "Text-to-Image" conversion pipeline rather than generative artistic AI, ensuring 100% accuracy of the input text in the output image.
